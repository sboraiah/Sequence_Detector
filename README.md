Sequence_Detector
=================

A description of Finite Transducer.

Finite Transducers are those machines which accepts input strings and convert them into a output strings.
Sequence Detector are the transducers which results in the output of 1 if the input sequence is detected or results in 0 if not
Let us assume that the  given sequence is 10010.

There are two types of transducers namely
1. Moore Machine: In the theory of computation, a Moore machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined solely by its current state.
2. Mealy Machine:In the theory of computation, a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs.
